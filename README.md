# Mathematical Modeling of "Dynamics of Love"

## Overview
This project explores the dynamics of love through mathematical modeling, inspired by the work of Steven H. Strogatz. By examining different romantic styles and their interactions, we simulate the complexity of relationships using linear differential equations.

## Objectives
- To model the dynamics of love between individuals using linear differential equations.
- To understand how different romantic styles impact relationship dynamics.
- To visualize the phase portraits of various relationship scenarios.

## Methodology
The project applies mathematical modeling to analyze the dynamics of love between two individuals. We explore various romantic styles, such as Eager Beaver, Narcissistic Nerd, Cautious Lover, and Hermit, and model their interactions using systems of linear differential equations. Phase portraits are used to visualize the outcomes of these interactions.

## Findings
Our analysis revealed that the dynamics of love are influenced significantly by the romantic styles of the individuals involved. For instance:
- Eager Beavers tend to have escalating affections when paired together.
- A relationship between a Narcissistic Nerd and a Cautious Lover often results in a stable, yet dynamic equilibrium.
- Hermits show diminishing affections over time, highlighting the complexity of isolationist tendencies in relationships.

## Visualizations
The project includes a series of plots and phase portraits that visualize the trajectories of relationships given different initial conditions and romantic styles. These visualizations provide insights into the stability and dynamics of love between individuals.

## Conclusion
The "Dynamics of Love" project offers a mathematical perspective on romantic relationships, shedding light on how different personalities interact over time. Through mathematical modeling, we gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and dynamics inherent in love.

## How to Use
This repository contains the mathematical models and visualizations generated during our study. To replicate our findings or explore new scenarios:
1. Review the mathematical models provided in the `models` directory.
2. Execute the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory to generate visualizations.
3. Modify the initial conditions or parameters to explore different dynamics.
